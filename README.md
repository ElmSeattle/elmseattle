# Elm Seattle website

The website is the hub for the elm programming language community in Seattle:
[http://elmseattle.org](http://elmseattle.org)

It should always have information about the next meeting, how to subscribe to the mailing list, and connect with other members.

## TODO

- Maybe it should be in in Elm?! When there are dynamic features needed...
- Or perhaps a static site with [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) and Elm?
- Integrate with MailChimp API for single-page sign-up to announce newsletter
- Integrate with EventBrite API for single-page registration for events

### Canonical location of code repo

Until [Aerobatic](http://bitbucket.aerobatic.com) has a Github integration, the code will be hosted on Bitbucket. We are using Aerobatic because of the useful features of the [API Request Proxy](http://bitbucket.aerobatic.com/blog/aerobatic-express-request-proxy.html)
